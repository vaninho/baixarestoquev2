A node/react project to make easier to discount from inventory products used inside the company.
He is a simple page with a form, the employer need to fill this form, or use the scanner to help on it.
Then the backend create a file with the software layout and I can import it.

I need to use a certified connection (https) since the privilegies needed to run the camera from device.
You can change it on server/index.js just comment/uncomment the lasts lines and you can run it on simple web service (http).
If you want to run on https, you gonna need to create a self signed certified (crt and key) with openssl and put in on server folder.

Thats it,
